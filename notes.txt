We need to remember to fill up errors when they cannot find the task by id
Set up conditional in backend...
"Task not found"

Our create form works now we just need to add it to our tasker page
Maybe we can jsonify in backend by using to_dict() so that we don't have to write jsonify in front end
Need to figure out form validations in front rather than backend cause its easier
